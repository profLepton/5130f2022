Bitcoin technologies provide an excellent way for decentralized payments. The decentralized systems are robust, they provide great security, are transparent, and ensure privacy. This term paper aims to apply this technology to theorize a messaging service using crypto technologies. The sender of the message ‘Alice’ can send a message to ‘Bob’ via any server that is willing to transmit the message without having to rely on a single commercial entity. This protocol proposes a ‘smart contract’ built on the block chain technology of bitcoin to allow the server to redeem ‘fees’ upon delivery of the message to ‘Bob’. When receiving a message, the Server enters a smart contract with Alice, which the server is able to redeem upon delivery of the message to Bob and receiving a confirmation from Bob. The details of this protocol will be highlighted in the term paper to follow.
