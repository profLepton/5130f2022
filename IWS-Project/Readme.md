# Permission number distribution system

PNDS is a website where professors and students can login using their UML credentials and setup and communicate permission numbers.


## How it works

Professors can login using their UML credentials, setup classes and store permission numbers for the classes on the website. They can set the minimum requirements that permission number requests from students must satisfy for any of their classes.

Students after logging in can see these requirements and then apply. The professor has a dashboard for each class with the requests where he can easily and quickly approve or deny these requests, in the event of which the website automatically emails the students.

The website keeps track of when and to whom each permission number was sent to, and how many permission numbers the professor may have.
It keeps track of this inventory and can even provide statistics.
